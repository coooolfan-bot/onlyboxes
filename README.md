# Onlyboxes

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Onlyboxes is a self-hosted code execution sandbox platform for individuals and small teams.

It uses a control-plane (`console`) and execution-plane (`worker`) architecture, and exposes both REST APIs and MCP tools.

## Key Features

- Self-hosted all components: control node (`console`) + worker nodes (`worker`)
- Separated control and execution planes:
  - Workers support **horizontal scaling**
  - Workers support multi-language **heterogeneous** implementations
  - Workers support **multiple runtimes**
- Full account system: resource isolation (stateful containers, sessions) between accounts
- MCP tools:
  - `pythonExec`: Python code execution
  - `terminalExec`: stateful terminal sessions
  - `readImage`: model-readable images
- REST API: all MCP tools also available via HTTP + async task API

> [!WARNING]
>
> In the current release, console (gRPC + HTTP) does not provide built-in TLS/mTLS.
>
> `worker` rejects insecure console endpoints by default; plaintext is allowed only when `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` is explicitly set.
>
> Put both console HTTP (`:8089`) and gRPC (`:50051`) endpoints behind your reverse proxy/gateway and enforce TLS for external traffic.

## One-Click Installer (Linux)

For a single-machine deployment of `console` + `worker-docker`, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://onlybox.es/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:

1. Check the environment (Linux, Docker, Docker Compose v2, systemd)
2. Download and render the compose template with auto-generated credentials
3. Start the console via `docker compose up -d`
4. Create a `normal` worker
5. Download the architecture-matched `worker-docker` release binary for the default latest version, or your `--tag` override
6. Generate and enable a systemd service for the worker
7. Poll until the worker comes online and print a result summary

Available options:

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--tag` | latest published release | Optional release version override |
| `--workdir` | `$PWD/onlyboxes` | Working directory |
| `--yes` / `-y` | `false` | Non-interactive mode, skip confirmations |
| `--console-http-port` | `8089` | Console HTTP port (host side) |
| `--console-grpc-port` | `50051` | Console gRPC port (host side) |
| `--service-name` | `onlyboxes-worker-docker` | systemd service name |

Requirements: Linux, systemd, Docker Engine, Docker Compose v2, Python 3.

## Quick Start (Manual)

### 1) Prerequisites

- Control node:
  - Docker Engine (binaries are also available in releases — no Docker needed if deploying via binary)
- Worker node:
  - Docker Engine (required by `worker-docker`)

### 2) Start the console service

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p onlyboxes-console && cd onlyboxes-console
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coooolfan/onlyboxes/refs/heads/main/docker/docker-compose.yml

    ```

2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and replace at least:
   - `CONSOLE_HASH_KEY`
   - `CONSOLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
3. Start console:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Default endpoints:

- Console Web UI / HTTP REST API / MCP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8089`
- gRPC: `127.0.0.1:50051`

### 3) Sign in and create an access token

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8089` in your browser.
- Sign in with the initialized admin account.
![Console login page](static/docs/quickstart-login.png)
- Go to the token management page and create an access token.
![Token created dialog (one-time plaintext token)](static/docs/quickstart-token-modal.png)
- Save the plaintext token immediately (it is returned only once).

### 4) Create a worker

- Go to Workers page and create a worker.
![Workers page](static/docs/quickstart-workers-page.png)
- Copy and securely store the startup command from the creation dialog (`WORKER_SECRET` is one-time visible).
![Worker created dialog (startup command and one-time secret)](static/docs/quickstart-worker-created-modal.jpg)
- (Optional) Click `Open in Startup Tool with Id and Secret` to open the startup command builder with the worker id and secret pre-filled.
  - On the opened page, you can edit all available options. The generated startup command appears at the bottom of the page — copy and save it.

### 5) Run worker

> [!WARNING]
> Workers support different runtimes and environments. Available worker implementations include `worker-docker`, `worker-boxlite`, `worker-sys`, and `worker-bridge-e2b`. This section uses the Docker runtime as an example.

1. Log in to the machine where the worker will be deployed.
    - Ensure Docker Engine is installed.
    - Ensure the worker can reach the console gRPC endpoint.
2. Download the latest `worker-docker` binary from GitHub Releases:
    - `https://github.com/onlyboxes/onlyboxes/releases/latest`
3. Use the startup command values from the dashboard, and replace the executable path on the last line with your downloaded binary.
    - Workers reject insecure console endpoints by default; set `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` only to allow plaintext connections.

    ```bash
    # Example
    WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true \
    WORKER_CONSOLE_GRPC_TARGET=127.0.0.1:50051 \
    WORKER_ID=<worker_id> \
    WORKER_SECRET=<worker_secret> \
    /path/to/onlyboxes-worker-docker
    ```

### 6) Verify readiness

- Confirm the worker is `online` on the dashboard Workers page.
- For REST API request examples, see `README/API.md`.
- If no tokens are configured, `/mcp` and execution APIs return `401` by design.
- Add the MCP endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8089/mcp` in any LLM Chat Client, set the token, and verify it works correctly.

## FAQ

- Q: Worker stays `offline` after starting?
  A: Check that `WORKER_CONSOLE_GRPC_TARGET` points to the correct console gRPC address and verify network connectivity.

- Q: Can a worker be deployed on the same machine as the console?
  A: Yes.

- Q: Can a worker run inside Docker?
  A: In theory, yes. However, it is not recommended because the worker needs access to the host Docker daemon. You would need to handle Docker-in-Docker yourself.

## Production Checklist

- Replace all default credentials.
- Use a reverse proxy to enforce TLS for `:8089` and `:50051`.
- Persist and back up the SQLite data directory (`CONSOLE_DB_PATH`).
- Run workers on isolated hosts to avoid sharing the Docker daemon with the console.
- Read the `Configuration Reference` below for all available options and adjust as needed.

## API Surfaces

- Dashboard auth: `/api/v1/console/*`
- Worker management (admin): `/api/v1/workers*`
- Command execution: `/api/v1/commands/echo`, `/api/v1/commands/terminal`
- Task execution: `/api/v1/tasks*`
- MCP (Streamable HTTP): `POST /mcp`

## Development

### Run backend from source

```bash
cd console
CONSOLE_HASH_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) go run ./cmd/console
```

### Run web dev server

```bash
yarn --cwd web install
yarn --cwd web dev
```

Web dev URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5178` and proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8089`.

## Security and Operational Notes

- Console does not provide built-in TLS/mTLS in this release; `worker-docker` requires explicit `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` to connect over plaintext.
- Put console HTTP (`:8089`) and gRPC (`:50051`) behind a reverse proxy/gateway and enforce TLS on public/external links.
- `WORKER_SECRET` and access token plaintext values are returned only at creation time.
- Dashboard login sessions are in-memory and are invalidated when `console` restarts.
